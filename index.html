                <p>"Most modern programming languages have more similarities than differences, and <span class="teal">Epicodus</span> graduates often find themselves working in different languages than they studied in school. Back-end programmers often switch languages as they change jobs, or even as they build different types of software at the same job. So don't stress too much about making the right choice! That said, each language has found a bit of a niche, and depending on your interests, you might be attracted to one over another."</p>

              <p>Ruby is a general purpose programming language created in the 1990s by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto. It’s also one of the best languages to start with when you’re first learning to code. If you’re currently working within the software industry or startup community, chances are you’ve heard of Ruby on Rails (often shortened to just Rails). Rails is a software framework for creating web applications.</p>
              <p>The TIOBE Programming Community Index lists Ruby as the 13th most popular programming language as of the time of writing this article.  Although popularity is a good thing, what’s better is <em>demand</em> Currently, Ruby is experiencing incredible growth in demand. Ruby has an excellent community and extensive amount of learning resources.</p>

With over twenty years and thousands of man-years of development, Java is a rock-solid platform.</p>
